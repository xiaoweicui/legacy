<h2> Description </h2>
<p> Hello, our game is Legacy. The game takes place in various settings as you pass the levels such as the desert. You are Garen the hero. Garen is trying to get home but there are monsters that will stop you. Garen will have to kill all the monsters to get home. The keys will move Garen. The monsters will get stronger as the level passes. If you kill all the monsters, you will reach the forest and there will be a portal to send the hero home. The game takes place in the desert. The objective of my game is to kill the monsters. The hero moves by using the left and right arrow keys. The hero shoots swords by pressing the spacebar. If the hero is hit by fireballs, the hero will lose health and when he loses all his health, game is over. If the heroâ€™s swords collides with the monster, the monster will lose health.
